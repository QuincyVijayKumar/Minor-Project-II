## Minor-Project-II
**To ensure smooth collaboration and keep our project up-to-date, please follow these steps for your daily work:**

1. **Pull Changes:** Before starting your work each day, make sure to pull the latest changes from the repository using `git pull` command. This ensures that you have the most recent updates from other team members.

2. **Create a Branch:** Next, create a new branch for the task you're working on using `git checkout -b <branch-name>`. This keeps your changes isolated and makes it easier to manage and review.

3. **Work on Your Task:** Make necessary changes to the codebase, fix bugs, or implement new features as per the task requirements.

4. **Commit Your Changes:** Once your work is complete, commit your changes using `git commit -m "Your commit message"`. Make sure to provide a descriptive commit message that explains the changes you've made.

5. **Push Your Branch:** After committing your changes, push your branch to the repository using `git push origin <branch-name>`. This makes your changes available for others to review and integrate into the main codebase.

6. **Pull Request:** Finally, create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main branch of the repository. Provide a clear title and description for your PR, summarizing the changes you've made. Assign reviewers if necessary and await feedback.
